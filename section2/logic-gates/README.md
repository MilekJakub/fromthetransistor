## Objective

Implement all logic gates mentioned below. The only building blocks that you can use are primitive NAND gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them.

## Gates

- NOT
- AND
- OR
- XOR
- Multiplexor
- Demultiplexor
- Multi-Bit NOT
- Multi-Bit AND
- Multi-Bit OR
- Multi-Bit Multiplexor
- Multi-Way Gates
