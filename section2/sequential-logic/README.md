# Latches and Flip-Flops

This directory contains a collection of basic and clocked memory elements implemented in Logisim.
Each component includes its Logisim circuit file and a rendered screenshot for quick reference.

The designs progress from simple SR latches to gated latches and finally to edge-triggered D flip-flops, illustrating the evolution of synchronous storage elements.
