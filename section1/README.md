## Section 1: Intro: Cheating our way past the transistor

I recommend to start with "Computer Science Crash Course" playlist.

Then you can start to read nandland blog and watch the rest of videos.

The most important thing is to understand how you can build logic gates from transistors.

Of course, this is only my opinion, it is probably not the best path to follow, but it is the path I followed.

## Books:

[The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686)

If reading technical books doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out, I really recommend it. This is really great book!
